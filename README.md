CordovaBrowser3
===============

A port of Evan Shapiro's Cordova Browser to cordova 3.3 to the 3.x API. 

This app allows loading of apps from a server, while allowing full access to the
cordova API. This makes development and debugging much faster. 

For the original which is for version 2.9 check:

    android update project --subprojects -p .
    cd -
    cordova build
